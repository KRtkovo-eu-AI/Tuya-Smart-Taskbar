# Changelog

All notable changes to Tuya Smart Taskbar will be documented in this file.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed
- **1–2 Hour Tray Event Freeze / Lockup** - Fixed a critical memory and OS handle leak where the 10-second auto-refresh loop reconstructed the entire native `Menu` tree on every cycle. Over time, registering thousands of duplicate items into Muda/Tao's internal event table corrupted event dispatch and exhausted OS menu handles, making tray clicks (toggles, settings, quit) unresponsive.
- **Initial Fan Speed Display** - Fixed fan speed showing level `1` on startup when running at other speeds (e.g. speed `3`). `TuyaValue` now parses string integers (`"3"`), percentage values (`60` -> level 3), and level identifiers (`"level_3"` / `"speed_3"`). Expanded DP code matching to support `"fan_speed_percent"`, `"fan_speed"`, `"speed"`, and `"fan_speed_enum"`.
- **Non-blocking Quit** - Removed `std::thread::sleep` from the main GUI event loop thread, allowing immediate app termination when clicking "Quit".
- **Token Refresh Failure Accounting** - Fixed rate-limit failure counter double-incrementing when a refresh token request fails and falls back to acquiring a new access token.
- **Tuya Token Expiry Error Handling** - Added explicit retry handling for Tuya API error code `1010` (token invalid/expired) in client retry logic.
- **Config Accessibility** - Converted static checkbox `<div>` to a semantic `<label for="runOnStartup">` with accessible markup, resolving Biome accessibility check errors.

### Added
- **Instant In-Place Control Feedback** - Changing multi-value controls (fan speed, temperature, AC fan speed, AC mode) now immediately updates checkmarks in the tray menu and local cache upon API success without waiting for the next polling cycle.
- **2-Space Formatter Configurations** - Configured 2-space indentation across both Biome (`biome.json`) and Rust (`rustfmt.toml`).
- **VS Code Workspace Settings** - Added `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/extensions.json` with default formatter associations and extension recommendations.
- **Unit Test Suites** - Added test suites for `update::is_newer_version`, `tuya::parse_fan_speed`, `tuya::parse_temperature`, and `tuya::TuyaValue::as_i64`.

### Changed
- **Decoupled Data Fetching from UI Construction** - Polling is split into `fetch_device_statuses` (network fetch) and `build_device_menu` (UI creation). During 10s auto-refresh, in-place updates mutate existing check menu items via `update_menu_items_in_place` without creating any new `Menu` or `CheckMenuItem` allocations.
- **Robust SemVer Comparison** - `update::is_newer_version` now safely trims `v` / `V` tag prefixes using array pattern matching.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Linux (Xubuntu) support** - Full cross-platform support with Linux bundle targets (AppImage, Deb, RPM), setup script, and PNG tray icon. ([#1](https://github.com/Adib23704/Tuya-Smart-Taskbar/pull/1))
- **Non-disruptive menu updates** - Auto-refresh now updates device states in-place without closing the open context menu. Check marks toggle in real-time while browsing the tray menu.
- **"Refresh Devices" menu item** - Manual refresh option in both the device menu and error menu, allowing users to retry after transient failures.
- **Offline device feedback** - Shows "No devices found" or "All N device(s) offline" in the tray menu when no online devices are available.
- **Biome linter/formatter** - Added `biome.json` configuration and lint/format/validate npm scripts for frontend code quality.
- **SVG accessibility** - All decorative SVGs now include `aria-hidden="true"` for accessibility compliance.

### Fixed
- **Update checker used string comparison instead of semver** - `commands/app.rs` now reuses the proper `is_newer_version()` from `update.rs` instead of naive `!=` comparison.
- **Update checker had no HTTP timeout** - Previously created `reqwest::Client::new()` with no timeout; now reuses the 10s-timeout client from `update.rs`.
- **Invalid `tar.gz` bundle target** - Removed from `tauri.conf.json` (not a valid Tauri v2 target), which was causing build failures.
- **Poisoned RwLock panics** - All `.unwrap()` calls on `RwLock` in `ConfigManager` replaced with `.unwrap_or_else(|p| p.into_inner())` to gracefully handle poisoned locks.
- **Atomic ordering too weak in token manager** - Changed `Ordering::Relaxed` to `Ordering::SeqCst` for `consecutive_failures` and `last_failure_time` atomics for proper cross-task synchronization.
- **Double read-lock on update state** - `update_tray_menu` previously acquired the `update_state` read lock twice in sequence; consolidated into a single acquisition.

### Changed
- **Menu item IDs are now stable** - Boolean toggles use `toggle:{deviceId}:{code}` format (handler reads current state from cache). Enum values use `set:{deviceId}:{code}:{value}`. This enables in-place updates without menu reconstruction.
- **Shared HTTP client** - `TuyaClient` and `TokenManager` now share a single `reqwest::Client` instance instead of creating separate ones.
- **Platform-neutral language** - Updated "Windows Taskbar App" to "System tray app" across `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `config.html`, and `about.html`.
- **Node.js version in setup script** - Updated from Node.js 18 (EOL) to Node.js 22 LTS.
- **Removed dead code** - Eliminated unused `should_check_for_update()`, `get_update_info()`, `CHECK_INTERVAL`, and `last_check` field from `update.rs`. Removed duplicate `UpdateInfo` struct and hardcoded URL from `commands/app.rs`.
- **Derived `PartialEq`** - `TuyaValue` and `TuyaDeviceStatus` now derive `PartialEq`, replacing ~35 lines of manual comparison code.

### Technical Details
- Introduced `MenuItemRegistry` (`Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, CheckMenuItem>>>`) for in-place menu item state updates via `set_checked()`
- Added `is_structural_change()` to detect when device set or status codes change (triggers full rebuild) vs value-only changes (in-place update)
- Added `update_menu_items_in_place()` for real-time boolean, integer, and string status updates without menu reconstruction
- Toggle handler provides immediate visual feedback by updating registry + cache right after successful API call
- Clippy-clean: fixed `redundant_closure`, `collapsible_else_if`, `needless_borrows_for_generic_args`, `manual_is_multiple_of`
- Biome-clean: tab indentation, single quotes, `noDescendingSpecificity` disabled for inline HTML styles

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- **Automatic update notifications** - The app now proactively notifies users when a new version is available through multiple channels:
  - **Tray menu indicator** - "Update Available (vX.X.X)" menu item appears at the top of the tray menu when an update is detected
  - **Windows toast notification** - A system notification is displayed when a new update is first detected
  - **Tray icon change** - The tray icon changes to indicate an update is available
  - **Tooltip update** - The tray tooltip shows "Update Available" with the new version number
- **Background update checking** - Updates are checked automatically on startup (after 3 second delay) and periodically every hour
- New `update.rs` module for centralized update state management with proper version comparison

### Fixed
- **App freezing after toggling switches** - Fixed a critical deadlock caused by holding a read lock across async operations. The lock is now properly scoped and released before triggering menu updates.
- **Quit menu option not working** - Fixed incorrect memory ordering (`Relaxed` -> `Release`/`Acquire`) that prevented the shutdown flag from being visible across threads. Added a brief delay before exit to allow async tasks to terminate gracefully.
- **Context menu closing during auto-refresh** - Added interaction tracking that skips auto-refresh for 2 seconds after any menu interaction, preventing the menu from disappearing while in use.
- **Race conditions during concurrent menu updates** - Added a `MenuUpdateLock` mutex to serialize menu updates. Auto-refresh now uses a 100ms timeout to acquire the lock and skips if another update is in progress.
- **Hanging refresh operations** - Added a 15-second timeout to the auto-refresh operation to prevent slow network requests from blocking the refresh loop indefinitely.

### Changed
- **Auto-refresh interval increased from 5s to 10s** - Reduces contention and network traffic while still providing timely device status updates.

### Technical Details
- Added `tauri-plugin-notification` for Windows toast notifications
- Created `SharedUpdateState` for thread-safe update status tracking across the application
- Update checks use proper semantic version comparison (e.g., 2.0.1 < 2.0.2 < 2.1.0)
- Notifications are shown only once per update detection to avoid notification spam
- Added `update.ico` tray icon for visual update indication
- Refactored command handler to scope `SharedTuyaClient` lock properly
- Added `MENU_INTERACTION_TIME` atomic for tracking user interactions
- Added `MenuUpdateLock` type for serializing menu operations
- Changed all `Ordering::Relaxed` to proper `Release`/`Acquire` pairs for thread synchronization
- Wrapped auto-refresh in `tokio::time::timeout` for better error handling
